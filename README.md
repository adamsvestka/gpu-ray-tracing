**Author:** Adam Å vestka

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:adamsvestka/gpu-ray-tracing.git
cd gpu-ray-tracing
make run

Make will *hopefully* take care of everything.

- `Camera rotation` - horizontal and vertical rotation of the camera in degrees
- `Render mode` - currently selected render mode
  - Ray Tracing - ray tracing with shadows and reflections
  - Normals - show normals of objects in the scene, useful for debugging
  - Depth - show distance of objects from the camera
  - Color - show unshaded colors of objects
- `Light position` - position of a sample light source in the scene, can be moved around
- `Light intensity` - intensity of the sample light source

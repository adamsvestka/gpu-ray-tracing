# Overview of Ray Tracing with OpenGL

This article introduces the basic concepts and algorithms used to achieve real-time ray tracing using modern hardware and software.

## Ray Tracing Fundamentals

_Ray tracing_ is a computer graphics rendering technique that simulates the physical behavior of light to generate realistic 3D images. It works by following the paths of light rays as they bounce around the scene, interacting with objects and materials in the environment.

The benefits of ray tracing include:

- Highly realistic images with accurate shading, reflections, and shadows.
- A consistent and intuitive rendering algorithm.

However, ray tracing comes with some challenges:

- Computationally expensive, especially for complex scenes with many objects and lights.
- Requires more memory compared to rasterization-based rendering techniques.

## Components in the Ray Tracing Algorithm

There are four main components in the ray tracing algorithm:

1. **Scene**: A collection of objects, materials, and lights that define the 3D environment.
2. **Camera**: Defines the view and projection used to render the scene.
3. **Rays**: Light rays that travel through the scene, interacting with objects and materials.
4. **Intersection tests**: Algorithms used to determine if and where a ray intersects an object in the scene.

The ray tracing algorithm works by generating rays from the camera, following their paths through the scene, and calculating the color and intensity of the light reaching the camera for each pixel in the image.

## Overview of the Ray Tracing Process

Here is an overview of the ray tracing process:

1. For each pixel in the image, generate a ray from the camera through that pixel.
2. Perform intersection tests to find the closest object that the ray intersects.
3. If the ray does not intersect any objects, set the pixel color to the background color, or in our case the color of global light sources.
4. If the ray intersects an object, calculate the color and intensity of the light at the intersection point using shading algorithms.
5. If the material of the intersected object is reflective, generate reflection rays from the intersection point and repeat steps 2-4.
6. Combine the light contributions from all ray paths to compute the final pixel color.

This process creates a highly accurate representation of light behavior, resulting in realistic shading.
